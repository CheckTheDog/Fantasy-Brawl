						<p><strong> Input: Gamepads (controllers) Input and vibration </strong></p>
						<p> As one of the code leads of CheckTheDog I have been responsible of building felxible easy to use functionts for my colleagues. 
						This allowed other programmers to easily interact with the system I created to gather and manipulate all the data and haptic features (vibration)
						of the controllers.</p>
			
						<p><strong> Input: Game controllers button customization </strong></p>
						<p> Since I had coded everything related to gamepads in our input module, I developed the buttons and triggers customization features,
						as well as their use in UI in the Options Screen.

						</p>
						
						<p><strong> Gameplay: Storm </strong></p>
						<p> The ruthless storm was assigned to my tasklist, and since it is something that needs a lot of balancing I built it as customizable as possible.
						The amount of times that the storm moves, the time it waits until it starts moving again, and the damage it causes to the players are amongst the variables that can
						be customized thrhough an xml document

						</p>
						
						<p><strong> Gameplay: Item manager </strong></p>
						<p> I worked on the item manager that deploys pseudo-random items in spawners located aroud the map. Game deigners can easily manipulate the positions and number of 
						spawn points by placing them as they want in Tiled, with the item manager managing all the data so designers don't need to worry about it and can freely place them.</p>
						
						<p><strong> Sprite in-game re escalation feature </strong></p>
						<p> Some sprites wouldn't be in perfect sync in terms of size or proportions relating to other elements on the screen, so I worked
						on a simple system to easily resize sprites in game to fit any needs.</p>
						
						<p><strong> UI: UI compatibility with gamepads </strong></p>
						<p> Since our game is fully played with gamepads I have been in charge of making the mouse based UI compatible with the gamepads.
						I also worked on the markers (feathers and arrows in customization screens) which helps the user quickly visualize which button he/she is interacting with.</p>
						
						<p><strong> Discarded gameplay: Bush based fog of war implementation </strong></p>
						<p> I worked on a fog of war bush based system, based on games like League of legends or Brawl Stars. It was based on a personal research I did for this same subject
						and it posed a challenge to adapt the implementation to 4 viewports and the complex data generation algorythm to efficiently manage visibility inside and outside the bushes. 
						Due to a combination of lack of time and the fact that it didn't seem to work with the gameplay of the game the feature was discarded midway production. </p>
						
						<p><strong> Twitter Community manager </strong></p>
						<p> I have also been in charge in udpating Twitter with the progress of the team and the different strategies to achieve visibility
						and user engagements in this social network.</p>
